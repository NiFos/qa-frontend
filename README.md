## Tech stack

- [Apollo Graphql](apollographql.com/): Client/Server Graphql Framework.

  **Apollo Server is an [open-source](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server), spec-compliant GraphQL server** that's compatible with any GraphQL client, including [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react). 

  **Apollo Client** is a comprehensive state management  library for JavaScript that enables you to manage both local and remote  data with GraphQL. Use it to fetch, cache, and modify application data,  all while automatically updating your UI.

- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): NoSql Database

  MongoDB it's a good document oriented database. I chose it because I prefer documents to storing posts data.
